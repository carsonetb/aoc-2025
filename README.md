# Advent of Code 2025

Written in Python, here is my code for as many days as possible for advent of code 2025. 

I am completing these on the day the challenge releases!

## Logs

- Dec 2: Day 1 solved, I completely forgot about advent of code yesterday.
- Dec 2: Day 2 solved, I accidentally solved part 2 before part 1, and also this looks like the perfect loading bar.
- Dec 2: Day 3 solved, got both of them first try (admittedly it was pretty easy)
- Dec 3: Day 4 solved, Part 1 took 30 minutes and part 2 took about 1 minute, also I am starting to clean up the code from previous days and add documentation.
